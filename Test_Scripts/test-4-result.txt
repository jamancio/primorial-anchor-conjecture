==================== PAC-4: MOD 2310 (P_5) VERIFICATION REPORT ====================

Total S_n Anchors Analyzed: 50,000,000
Total Law I Failures (Overall): 6,599,607
Total 'Perfect' (S_n % 2310 == 0) Anchors Found: 120,274

Total Composite k Failures from Perfect Anchors: 0
  No composite k failures were observed from perfect anchors.

>>> VIOLATIONS (k % 3, 5, 7, or 11 == 0): 0


==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: CONJECTURE VERIFIED for P_5]
  The hypothesis is confirmed with 100% accuracy for P_5 across the test range.
  Perfect S_n % 2310 == 0 anchors produced ZERO failures
  divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11.

  No composite failures were observed from perfect anchors, confirming immunity.

  This further strengthens the PAC.
