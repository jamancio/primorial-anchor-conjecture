## Abstract

This paper presents the definitive findings regarding the **Primorial Anchor Conjecture (PAC)**. This conjecture arose from the investigation of the "Prime Anchor System" (PAS), which studied the properties of anchor points $S_n = p_n + p_{n+1}$. Initial PAS research revealed non-random behavior ("Laws I & II") related to the distance $k$ to the nearest prime $q$, $k = |S_n - q|$. This behavior was ultimately identified as a "Primorial Filter" effect. The PAC formalizes this insight, proposing that the arithmetic nature of the rare composite-$k$ failures originating from the natural $S_n$ sequence is **deterministically classified** by the anchor's primorial signature ($S_n \pmod{P_k}$). A large-scale computational test, the **"PAC Classifier Suite,"** was conducted over the first 50,000,000 prime pairs. The results **verified the conjecture with zero violations** across the $P_2=6$, $P_3=30$, and $P_4=210$ filters. Notably, the test confirmed that $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{210}$ anchors are immune to failures divisible by 3, 5, or 7, with the *only* observed failure for such anchors being the predicted $k=121$. This provides powerful evidence for a deep, predictive, primorial structure governing the local behavior of the $S_n$ sequence.

## 1. Core Definitions and Background

The investigation originates from the "Prime Anchor System" (PAS), which defined:
1.  **The Anchor Point ($S_n$):** The sum of two consecutive primes, $S_n = p_n + p_{n+1}$ (for $n \ge 1$).
2.  **The Distance ($k$):** The absolute distance from an anchor $S_n$ to any prime $q$, $k = |S_n - q|$.
3.  **The "Law I Failure":** An instance where the distance $k_{min}$ to the *closest* prime $q$ is a composite number.

Analysis of these "Law I Failures" across the first 50 million prime pairs reveals that they are not random but are heavily skewed towards specific small composite numbers. An independent analysis script (`analyze_composite_k_distribution.py`) quantified this distribution:

**Distribution of Top Composite $k_{min}$ Values (Law I Failures)**

| Composite $k_{min}$ | Frequency Count | Percentage of Total Failures |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :--------------------------- |
| 9                   | 2,845,621       | 43.12%                       |
| 15                  | 1,252,635       | 18.98%                       |
| 25                  | 740,891         | 11.23%                       |
| 21                  | 706,630         | 10.71%                       |
| 27                  | 391,464         | 5.93%                        |
| 35                  | 226,689         | 3.43%                        |
| 33                  | 181,120         | 2.74%                        |
| *Others* | *~253,000* | *~3.84%* |
| **TOTAL** | **6,599,606** | **100.00%** |



This data shows that over 84% of all Law I failures are caused by just four composite distances ($k=9, 15, 21, 25$). Initial PAS research (Versions 1.0-7.0) discovered that this structure was linked to a $\pmod 6$ property of $S_n$. Further investigation revealed this was part of a broader "Primorial Filter" mechanism. The attempt to analyze ideal primorial grids ($\pmod{P_k}$) proved fruitless, yielding a 0% failure rate due to the test methodology. This confirmed that the **natural $S_n$ sequence**, with its inherent imperfections generating the specific failure distribution shown above, is the correct object of study.

## 2. The Primorial Anchor Conjecture (PAC)

The PAC proposes that the seemingly "messy" composite-$k$ failures generated by the natural $S_n$ sequence are, in fact, perfectly ordered according to primorial arithmetic.

**Conjecture:** Let $S_n = p_n + p_{n+1}$ be an anchor point, and let $k_{min}$ be the composite distance to the nearest prime $q$. Let $P_k = 2 \times 3 \times \dots \times p_k$ be the $k$-th primorial. If the anchor $S_n$ is a multiple of $P_k$ (i.e., $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{P_k}$), then the resulting composite failure $k_{min}$ **cannot** be divisible by any prime $p \le p_k$.

* **For $P_2=6$:** If $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod 6$, then $k_{min}$ cannot be divisible by 3.
* **For $P_3=30$:** If $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{30}$, then $k_{min}$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 5.
* **For $P_4=210$:** If $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{210}$, then $k_{min}$ cannot be divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

This conjecture implies that the primorial signature of the $S_n$ anchor acts as a perfect filter, deterministically constraining the possible arithmetic forms of its local composite failures.

## 3. Definitive Computational Verification: The PAC Classifier Suite

To test the PAC, a definitive computational analysis, the **"[PAC Classifier Suite](Test_Scripts/test-2-pac-classifier.py)"**, was performed over the first 50,000,000 consecutive prime pairs ($p_n, p_{n+1}$), starting from $n=10$ (to avoid small prime anomalies).

**Methodology:**
1.  For each $S_n$ in the range, the closest prime $q$ and its distance $k_{min}$ were identified.
2.  If $k_{min}$ was composite (a "Law I Failure"), the anchor $S_n$ and the failure $k_{min}$ were recorded.
3.  Each failure event was simultaneously tested against the $P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$ filter conditions based on the value of $S_n \pmod{P_k}$.
4.  The test specifically hunted for **violations**: instances where $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{P_k}$ but the resulting $k_{min}$ *was* divisible by a prime factor of $P_k$.

**Results:**
The test analyzed **6,599,607** composite-$k$ failures across the 50 million pairs. The results provided **100% confirmation** of the PAC:

| Filter  | Anchor Condition         | Forbidden $k$ Divisors | Total Failures from "Perfect" Anchors | Observed Violations |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------ |
| $P_2=6$ | $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod 6$   | 3                        | 752,637                               | **0** |
| $P_3=30$| $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{30}$  | 3, 5                     | 9,907                                 | **0** |
| $P_4=210$| $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{210}$ | 3, 5, 7                  | **1** | **0** |



**Key Finding:** The single failure observed for an anchor $S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{210}$ occurred at $k=121$. As $121 = 11^2$, it is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, perfectly aligning with the conjecture's prediction and the theoretical expectation.

## 4. Conclusion

The Primorial Anchor Conjecture (PAC) is **verified** across the first 50,000,000 prime pairs. The $\pmod{P_k}$ signature of a natural anchor point $S_n = p_n + p_{n+1}$ **deterministically classifies** the arithmetic nature of its composite distance failures ($k_{min}$). "Perfect" anchors ($S_n \equiv 0 \pmod{P_k}$) are demonstrably immune to composite failures divisible by the filter's constituent primes.

This result provides a definitive explanation for the structured behavior observed in the original PAS research. It establishes the $S_n$ sequence as a natural object governed by deep, predictable primorial laws, offering a novel tool for analyzing the local distribution of prime numbers and its connection to fundamental sieve principles. The initial PAS investigation, while ultimately superseded, served as the essential prototype leading to this significant structural finding.
